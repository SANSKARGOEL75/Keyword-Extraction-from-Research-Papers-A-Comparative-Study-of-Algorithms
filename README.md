# Keyword-Extraction-from-Research-Papers-A-Comparative-Study-of-Algorithms

Welcome to Keyword Extraction from Research Papers, A-Comparative-Study-of-Algorithms, In this research we have considered different models and their implementation to derive differences among all the opinions of the individual based on the algorithms. We have first studied conversion of pdf to text and then how to extract keywords from the document using some different algorithms namely RAKE, YAKE and TF-IDF and modified them in a way such that we get best extracted keywords which relates to the document and help us understanding the document. At the end, we have compared different algorithms on the basis of the extracted keywords. It further provided us with the judgment of identifying the most efficient algorithm among all. Given the factual truth, we could guess which approach works best for the opinion of best keywords.
